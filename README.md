Truffle, React, Redux Toolkit, Web3.js boilerplate

## Getting Started

2 ways to use:
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/adriandelgg/Truffle-React-Redux-Boilerplate`
2. Use it as a template by clicking the "Use as template" green button on the top right and creating a new repository with it. You can then clone your own repo templated off of this one.

After clone or template:

1. Once downloaded, run `$ npm install` to install all dependencies from the folder's main directory.

2. Next, go into "client" folder and install all the dependencies there.

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

## More Info

`truffle.config` file is set to work with Ganache GUI out of the box. All you have to do is connect your contracts to Ganache through Ganache to start developing and testing locally.
